# Diffusion model with Mnist-Fashion

### Dataset
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article imagesâ€”consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

### The model
I built the model using the `diffusers` and `torch` libraries. I utilized a classic UNet2DModel with an nn.Embedding layer, which allows me to guide the model to generate images from a specific class rather than producing random images from noise.


### Results
After a few dozen epochs model generates really good images with some "details".  For example, here are the original photos:

And here are the images generated by the model after approximately sixty epochs:

### Setup configuration
Diffusion models are highly computationally demanding. However, the dataset consists of single-channel (black and white) images with dimensions of 28x28 pixels. This makes it feasible to train the model on platforms like Google Colab, which is a cost-effective and efficient option.
